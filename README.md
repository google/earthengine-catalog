# Google Earth Engine Public Data Catalog

This repository contains content submitted and/or maintained by the Earth Engine
user community.

# STAC

[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)](https://stacspec.org/) is a standard for
describing spatial datasets in a catalog.

Earth Engine uses STAC [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org) templates to generate the
[Earth Engine Public Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog)
and the
[STAC JSON catalog](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/earthengine-stac).
Using Jsonnet
allows repetitive content to be written one time and used across multiple
collections and items.

You can use externally hosted services to browse the STAC catalog:

- [RadiantEarth STAC Browser](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/external/storage.googleapis.com/earthengine-stac/catalog/catalog.json)
- [STAC Index](https://stacindex.org/catalogs/google-earth-engine)
- [gee.stac.cloud](https://gee.stac.cloud/)

The issue tracker is currently disabled. In the future, we plan to enable the
issue tracker.

# Build

## Requirements

- [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)
- [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org)

We have instructions for Debian-based Linux distributions and recommend using
[DebianTesting](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting).

It is possible to work on this repository using other operating systems such as
Windows, MacOS X, or other Linux distributions. However, we do not currently
have instructions.

## Setup

You will need to install Bazel and Jsonnet. On Debian-based Linux systems:

```shell
sudo apt-get install bazel jsonnet
```

## Building

```shell
bazel build //...
```

If that doesn't work, you might need to specify the Java JDK path. This example
is using bash:

```shell
PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin:$PATH bazel build //...
```

Finding the results:

```shell
ls bazel-bin/catalog/
```

# Non-commercial datasets

[non_commercial_datasets.jsonnet](https://github.com/google/earthengine-catalog/blob/main/non_commercial_datasets.jsonnet)
contains a list of datasets that have
licenses known to exclude commercial use. If you are using Earth Engine
in a commercial capacity, these datasets are not available.
