    The USGS Land Cover program integrates methodologies from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP), along with advanced deep learning, to create
    Annual NLCD a dataset suite that includes six products, each representing various U.S. land cover and change characteristics. The U.S. Geological Surveyâ€™s (USGS) Annual NLCD Collection 1.0 leverages innovations
    from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) projects, incorporating modern deep learning techniques to deliver accurate, annual land cover and surface
    change data across the U.S.

    Since 1985, Annual NLCD provides six products covering land cover, change, confidence, impervious surfaces, and spectral changes based on Landsat data, facilitating resource management and decision-making.These
    products leverage Landsat satellite data and are intended for applications in science, resource management, and decision-making, spanning from 1985 to 2023. This dataset supports various environmental analyses,
    such as urban growth studies, wetland monitoring, agricultural management, and climate impact assessments. Its annual updates and classification confidence features provide essential insights for long-term land use
    planning and change detection. You can acces [User Guide here](https://www.mrlc.gov/sites/default/files/docs/LSDS-2103%20Annual%20National%20Land%20Cover%20Database%20(NLCD)%20Collection%201%20Science%20Product%20User%20Guide%20-v1.0%202024_10_15.pdf)
