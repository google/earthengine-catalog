  title: 'MERIT Hydro: Global Hydrography Datasets',
  version: '1.0.1',
  'gee:type': ee_const.gee_type.image,
  description: |||
    MERIT Hydro is a new global flow direction map at 3 arc-second resolution (~90
    m at the equator) derived from the version 1.0.3 of the MERIT DEM elevation data
    and water body datasets (G1WBM, GSWO and OpenStreetMap).

    MERIT Hydro contains the output of a new algorithm that
    extracts river networks near-automatically by separating actual inland basins from
    noise caused by the errors in input elevation data. After a minimum
    amount of hand-editing, the constructed hydrography map shows good agreement with
    existing quality-controlled river network datasets in terms of flow accumulation
    area and river basin shape (see Figure 9a in the paper). The location of river
    streamlines was realistically aligned with existing satellite-based global
    river channel data (see Figure 10a in the paper). Relative error
    in the drainage area was smaller than 0.05 for 90% of GRDC gauges, confirming
    the accuracy of the delineated global river networks. Discrepancies in flow accumulation
    area were found mostly in arid river basins containing depressions that are occasionally
    connected at high water levels and thus resulting in uncertain watershed boundaries.

    MERIT Hydro improves on existing global hydrography datasets in terms of spatial
    coverage (between 90N and 60S) and representation of small streams, mainly due
    to increased availability of high-quality baseline geospatial datasets.

    [You can use this web app to visualize MERIT Hydro data.](https://meritdataset.users.earthengine.app/view/merit-hydro-visualization-and-interactive-map)
    [The app's source code is available.](https://github.com/google/earthengine-community/blob/master/datasets/scripts/Hydro_Visualization.js)

    Known Problems:

    * River width (Update from GWD-LR v1): Width algorithm was updated to consider
      sub-pixel water fraction. Now, 30 m water map is used for width calculation at
      90 m resolution. Currently river width is calculated for each channel separately
      in braided/anabranching sections. Merged river width should be calculated.
    * Water body map: There are some inconsistencies between the DEM land sea mask and
      wate body data (such as new islands along the coast). The quality of OpenStreeetMap
      water body layer is not uniform in all areas.
    * Channel bifurcations: Channel bifurcation is not well represented in the current
      version. Each pixel is assumed to have only one downstream direction. Secondary
      (or multiple) downstream direction should be considered, to represent complex
      river networks in the delta regions, floodplains, and braided rivers.
    * Underground rivers/tunnels: Major underground rivers/tunnels should be implemented
      to improve large-scale water balance.
    * River/lake separation: Rivers and lakes need to be separated better for some applications.
    * Below-sea-level areas: The areas below sea level in coastal regions are not well
      represented in adjusted elevation data.
    * Flow direction over glaciers: Flow direction over glaciers is not well represented,
      because the elevation of glacier centerline is higher than glacier edge.
    * Supplementary data: It would be better to add location of GRDC gauging stations, water
      falls, reservoirs, etc.

          Hydrologically adjusted elevations, also know as "hand" (height above

          satisfy the condition "downstream is not higher than its upstream" while
          minimizing the required modifications from the original DEM.  The elevation
          above EGM96 geoid is represented in meters, and the vertical increment is set to
