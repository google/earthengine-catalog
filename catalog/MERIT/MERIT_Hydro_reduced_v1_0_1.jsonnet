          calculated by the method described in [Yamazaki et al. 2012, WRR], with some

    Citation to the paper is adequate if you simply use MERIT Hydro. If you
    asked for help for additional handling/editing of the dataset, or if your research
    outcome highly depends on the product, the developer would request co-authorship.
