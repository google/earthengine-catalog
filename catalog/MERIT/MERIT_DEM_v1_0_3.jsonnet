  description: |||
    MERIT DEM a high accuracy global DEM at 3 arc second resolution (~90 m at
    the equator) produced by eliminating major error components from existing DEMs
    (NASA SRTM3 DEM, JAXA AW3D DEM, Viewfinder Panoramas DEM).

    MERIT DEM separates absolute bias, stripe noise, speckle
    noise and tree height bias using multiple satellite datasets and filtering techniques.
    After the error removal, land areas mapped with 2 m or better vertical accuracy
    were increased from 39% to 58%. Significant improvements were found in flat regions
    where height errors larger than topography variability, and landscapes such as
    river networks and hill-valley structures became clearly represented.

    'MERIT DEM was developed by processing the following products as baseline data:

    * [NASA SRTM3 DEM v2.1](https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3)
    * [JAXA AW3D - 30 m DEM v1](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/aw3d30/index.htm)
    * [Viewfinder Panoramas DEM](http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html)

    In addition to the above baseline dems, these products were used as supplementary data:

    * [NASA-NSIDC ICESat/GLAS GLA14 data](https://nsidc.org/data/gla14)
    * [U-Maryland Landsat forest cover data](https://glad.earthengine.app/view/global-forest-change)
    * [NASA Global Forest height data](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/forest-height-map.html)
    * [JAMSTEC/U-Tokyo G3WBM water body data](http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/G3WBM/index.html)

    asked for help for additional handling/editing of the dataset, or if your research
    outcome highly depends on the product, the developer would request co-authorship.
