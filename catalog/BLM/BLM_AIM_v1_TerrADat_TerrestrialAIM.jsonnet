  description: |||
    Since 2011, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has collected field information
    to inform land health through its Assessment Inventory and Monitoring (AIM)
    strategy. To date, more than 6,000 terrestrial AIM field plots have been
    collected over BLM lands.  The BLM AIM data archive is updated annually.
    Standardized core indicators are collected at each plot that are known to be
    both ecologically relevant and clearly tied to rangeland health. These
    indicators inform biotic integrity, soil and site stability, and hydrologic
    function. The terrestrial plot measurements include fractional bare ground
    cover, vegetation composition and height, plants of management concern,
    Non-native invasive species, plant canopy gaps, species richness, and soil
    aggregate stability. AIM represents one of the most extensive, publicly
    available plot measurement datasets across Western US federal lands, which can
    be integrated with remotely sensed imagery and other geospatial information for
    a range of analysis, classification, and validation purposes.

    This dataset was created to monitor the status, condition and trend
    of national BLM resources in accordance with BLM policies.  The
    methodology used for the collection of these data can be found on
    https://landscapetoolbox.org and the Monitoring Manual, 2nd Edition.  These
    data should not be used for statistical or spatial inferences without
    knowledge of how the sample design was drawn or without calculating
    spatial weights for the points based on the sample design.

    This feature class includes monitoring data collected nationally to
    understand the status, condition, and trend of resources on BLM
    lands. Data are collected in accordance with the BLM Assessment,
    Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) Strategy. The AIM Strategy specifies
    a probabilistic sampling design, standard core indicators and
    methods, electronic data capture and management, and integration with
    remote sensing. Attributes include the BLM terrestrial core
    indicators: bare ground, vegetation composition, plant species of
    management concern, non-native invasive species, and percent canopy
    gaps (see Entity/Attribute Section for exact details on attributes).
    Data were collected and managed by BLM Field Offices, BLM Districts,
    and/or affiliated field crews with support from the BLM National
    Operations Center. Data are stored in a centralized database
    (TerrADat) at the BLM National Operations Center.

    Data were collected by trained data collectors with the BLM and
    partner organizations. They followed the BLM core terrestrial data
    [collection protocols](https://www.ntc.blm.gov/krc/viewresource.php?courseID=281&programAreaId=148).
    Data were captured electronically using the [Database for Inventory,
    Monitoring, and Assessment](https://jornada.nmsu.edu/monit-assess/dima).
    They were managed by the
    data collectors, with oversight from BLM field offices, state
    offices, and the National Operations Center. This dataset has
    undergone rigorous QA/QC to ensure data quality.

          Duplicate Plot IDs might exist among different Sites and Projects,
          but not within the same Site.  Each AIM plot is the center point of
          a 55-meter radius (110-meter diameter) circle in which monitoring
          indicators (dataset attributes) were collected.  Points were
          randomly selected using a spatially balanced sampling design within
          the desired inference space.  Most of the attributes were collected
          along three 50- or 25-meter transects, offset from the center point
          by 5 meters, radiating out from the center point at 0, 120, and 240
          degrees.
