          Horizontal Shift in longitude.
          The positional shift in longitude applied to each posting in the source DEM to convert from NAD27 coordinates to NAD83 coordinates. These values will be zero if the source DEM's HDATUM field value is 83, 84 or 72. (WGS84 is nearly identical to NAD83, and WGS72 is sufficiently similar that no shift was deemed necessary). The shift values were obtained from NGS's NADCON software, and were calculated at the nominal center of each quadrangle.
          New high-resolution DEMs introduced after April 1, 2014 generally have a horizontal datum of NAD83 and this field will be populated with -100.

          Elevation Resolution

          For DEMs derived from standard USGS paper map series, this field,
          together with ZUNIT, defines vertical resolution of the source DEM.
          Typical values are 1 and 0.1, though others are possible.

          Example: ZSTEP = 0.1 This indicates that the source DEM records
          elevations to the nearest tenth of a meter.

          A value of 0 is used when this field does not apply, as in the case
          of source data with floating point precision.

          New high-resolution DEMs introduced after April 1, 2014 all have
          floating point precision, and this field will be populated with -100.
