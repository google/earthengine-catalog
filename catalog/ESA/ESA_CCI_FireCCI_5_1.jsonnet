  title: 'FireCCI51: MODIS Fire_cci Burned Area Pixel Product, Version 5.1',
  version: '5.1',
  'gee:type': ee_const.gee_type.image_collection,
  description: |||
    The MODIS Fire_cci Burned Area pixel product version 5.1 (FireCCI51)
    is a monthly global ~250m spatial resolution dataset
    containing information on burned area as well as ancillary data. It is based
    on surface reflectance in the Near Infrared (NIR) band from the MODIS
    instrument onboard the Terra satellite, as well as active fire information from
    the same sensor of the Terra and Aqua satellites.

    The burned area algorithm uses a two-phase hybrid approach. In a first step
    pixels with a high probability of being burned (called "seeds") are detected
    based on the active fires. In a second one, a contextual growing is applied to
    completely detect the fire patch. This growing phase is controlled by an
    adaptive thresholding, where thresholds are computed based on the specific
    characteristics of the area surrounding each seed. The variable used to guide
    the whole detection process is the NIR drop between pre- and post-fire images.

    The dataset includes for each pixel the estimated day of the first detection of
    the fire, the confidence level of that detection, and the land cover that has
    been burned (extracted from the ESA CCI Land Cover dataset v2.0.7). In addition,
    an observation flag is provided to identify the pixels that were not processed due
    to the lack of valid observations or because they belong to a non-burnable land
    cover.

    FireCCI51 was developed as part of the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI)
    Programme, and it is also part of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).
