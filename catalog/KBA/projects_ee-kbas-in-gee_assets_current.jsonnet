  version: 'September 2025',

    **If you are interested in accessing the KBA dataset please complete the 
	[KBA data request form](https://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-data/request) 
	which will allow access directly in GEE once approved.**
	
	Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are 'sites contributing 
	significantly to the global persistence of biodiversityâ€™, 
	in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Sites 
	can be identified as KBAs if they meet at least one of
	the KBA criteria set out in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) for threatened or geographically 
	restricted species or ecosystems, ecological integrity, biological processes, or 
	irreplaceability. Both tabular and spatial data for KBAs are 
	managed in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas (WDKBA). 
	
	The identification of KBAs draws upon the efforts of huge networks 
	of local experts and relies on locally collected data. The process 
	to reassess existing or identify new KBAs, is highly inclusive, 
	consultative and nationally driven. Anyone with appropriate data may 
	propose a site as a KBA, although consultation with relevant stakeholders 
	at the local and national level is required when identifying the site and 
	needs to be documented in the proposal. KBAs can be identified by a KBA 
	National Coordination Group (KBA NCG) if this has been established in a 
	country or by an individual or small group of proposers. Further information 
	about KBAs can be found on the [KBA website](https://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/).
	
	**Data Sources.** Sites of importance for biodiversity that had been identified using other
	pre-existing criteria formed the basis of the KBA dataset prior to the 
	launch of the KBA Standard in 2016. These were principally the Important
	Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) identified by BirdLife International, 
	plus Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites and KBAs covering multiple 
	taxonomic groups in freshwater, marine and terrestrial systems under previously 
	published criteria. Since 2016, many of these sites have been reassessed 
	against the Global Standard.

	Currently, the global KBA network consists of >16,500 sites and these are classified
	as Global (those meeting Global KBA criteria), Regional (those not meeting Global KBA 
	criteria but continuing	to meet other pre-existing criteria) or Global/ Regional to
	be determined (those legacy sites with insufficient information to demonstrate whether
	they meet Global KBA criteria). Further details about the current KBA dataset are published
	on the KBA website.
	
	**Asset Naming Conventions.** An updated version of the WDKBA is currently
	released every six months. The most recent version is permanently available 
	as projects/ee-kbas-in-gee/assets/current. Previous versions, starting from 
	March 2025, are available in the format projects/ee-kbas-in-gee/assets/YYYYMM.
