NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three
components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2. GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely
with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally
consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination
of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use
data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are
"open-loop" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as
DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2
products.
