  description: |||
    This dataset provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and
    belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300-m spatial resolution. The
    aboveground biomass map integrates land-cover specific, remotely sensed maps of woody,
    grassland, cropland, and tundra biomass. Input maps were amassed from the published literature
    and, where necessary, updated to cover the focal extent or time period. The belowground biomass
    map similarly integrates matching maps derived from each aboveground biomass map and land-cover
    specific empirical models. Aboveground and belowground maps were then integrated separately
    using ancillary maps of percent tree cover and landcover and a rule-based decision tree. Maps
    reporting the accumulated uncertainty of pixel-level estimates are also provided.

    Provider's note: The UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring
    Centre (UNEP-WCMC) carbon biomass dataset
    represents conditions between 1982 and 2010 depending on land cover type. The relative patterns
    of carbon stocks are well represented with this dataset. The [NASA/ORNL carbon biomass dataset](https://daac.ornl.gov/VEGETATION/guides/Global_Maps_C_Density_2010.html)
    represents biomass conditions for 2010, with uncertainty estimates at the pixel-level.
    Additional biomass of non-dominant land cover types are represented within each pixel. For more
    detailed information, please refer to the papers describing each dataset: [WCMC](WCMC_biomass_carbon_density_v1_0)
