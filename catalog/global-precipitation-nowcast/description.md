This dataset provides a global nowcast of precipitation from 2020 to 2025,
generated using advanced machine learning methods applied to observations from
multiple satellite platforms. The product offers high-resolution precipitation
estimates at a spatial resolution of 5 km and a temporal resolution of 3 hours,
making it suitable for a wide range of applications requiring near real-time
precipitation information, such as hydrological modeling, disaster monitoring,
and agricultural management. The machine learning approach leverages the
strengths of various satellite sensors to provide a comprehensive and robust
precipitation nowcast, even in regions with sparse ground-based observations.
