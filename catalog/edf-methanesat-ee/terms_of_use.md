    * (2) With respect to certain aspects of the Data as described herein, you may use methane concentrations, in parts per billion or any other unit of concentration (“Level 3 Data” or “L3 Data”) and methane emission fluxes, in kilograms per hour (“Level 4 Data” or “L4 Data”) for: 
        * (i) internal business evaluation and testing,
        * (ii) commercial applications, such as developing and selling derivative products and services that incorporate or are informed by the L3 Data or L4 Data, 
        * (iii) distribution of the Data made available herein to wholly controlled affiliates of which you will be responsible and liable on their behalf for adherence to these Terms of Use, or 
        * (iv) methane mitigation activities, including both commercial and non-commercial initiatives; 
    * (3) You are strictly prohibited from using L3 Data to calculate or derive L4 Data or any similar outputs, except and exclusively for internal use purposes and not to distribute to any third party; 
    * (4) You may not distribute, publish, sublicense, sell, or otherwise provide L3 Data or L4 Data in its raw form to any third parties, provided, however, that you may develop, commercialize, and sell derivative products and services based on your review of the L3 Data and L4 Data, provided, further (and for the avoidance of doubt), that the underlying L3 Data and L4 Data (in its raw form) shall not be shared nor made directly accessible to end users/third parties; and 
    * (5) That you are not permitted to distribute the Data on any other platform that would make the Data available to third parties, other than to you and your wholly controlled affiliates.

        * (ii) share anonymized insights on target customers and market applications; 
    * (2) MethaneSAT may use aggregated or anonymized insights to refine its Data offerings.
