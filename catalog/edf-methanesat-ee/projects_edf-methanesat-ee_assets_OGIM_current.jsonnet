  title: 'OGIM: Oil and Gas Infrastructure Mapping Database v' + version,
  version: version,

  description: |||
    This dataset provides the locations of oil and gas (O&G) related
    infrastructure globally.

    The Oil and Gas Infrastructure Mapping (OGIM) database is a project
    developed by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and [MethaneSAT LLC](https://www.methanesat.org/),
    a wholly-owned subsidiary of EDF. The primary objective of developing
    a standardized O&G infrastructure database such as OGIM is to support
    MethaneSAT's emission quantification, source characterization, and other
    scientific- or advocacy-relevant analyses of methane emissions from the oil
    and gas sector. The OGIM database is developed based on the acquisition,
    analysis, and quality assurance of publicly available geospatial data
    sources of O&G facilities, which are combined within one standard data
    schema and coordinate reference system.

    This dataset contains the spatial locations of the following types of
    infrastructure assets:

    * oil and natural gas wells,
    * oil and gas pipelines,
    * natural gas compressor stations,
    * gathering and processing facilities,
    * tank batteries,
    * offshore platforms,
    * liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities,
    * crude oil refineries,
    * petroleum terminals,
    * injection and disposal facilities,
    * equipment and component locations,
    * satellite detections of oil and gas flares,
    * and "other" oil and gas related infrastructure, such as metering stations


    Records in the OGIM are consolidated from numerous publicly-available
    governmental and academic sources. This list of sources is available [in the
    OGIM_v2.7_Data_Source_References.pdf](https://zenodo.org/records/15103476)
    document. For more information on each source, refer to the "Data_Catalog"
    table that accompanies [Omara et al (2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-3761-2023).

    Important notes about the attributes associated with these facility locations:

    - Missing values (i.e., values missing or not reported by the original data
    source) are handled by assigning "N/A" to string attributes, -999 to
    numerical attributes, and a generic date of "1900-01-01" to date/datetime
    attributes.

    - Facility operator names have not been altered in any way from the original
    source of data and are assumed to be accurate as of the original source's
    publication date.

    For more information about the OGIM database, including methods used in its
    development and key applications of the database, please refer to the recent
    publication by [Omara et al, 2023](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-3761-2023).

    This dataset will be updated in-place with the new versions.
