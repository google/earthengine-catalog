Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that has more than 80 times the warming power
of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. At
least 30% of today's global warming is driven by methane from human actions.
[Cutting methane](https://www.edf.org/issue/methane) emissions associated with human activities - including avoidable
emissions from oil and gas operations, agriculture, and waste management - is one of the [fastest ways to 
slow the rate of global warming](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4f10).
