    This product is part of the Landscape Change Monitoring System (LCMS) data
    suite. It shows LCMS-modeled change, land cover, and/or land use classes
    for each year. This LCMS version covers Puerto Rico U.S. Virgin Islands (PRUSVI).

    LCMS is a remote sensing-based system for mapping and monitoring landscape
    change across the United States. Its objective is to develop a consistent
    approach using the latest technology and advancements in change detection to
    produce a "best available" map of landscape change.

    Outputs include three annual products: change, land cover, and land use.
    Change relates specifically to vegetation cover and includes slow loss, fast
    loss (which also includes hydrologic changes such as inundation or
    desiccation), and gain. These values are predicted for each year of the
    Landsat time series and serve as the foundational products for LCMS. Land
    cover and land use maps depict life-form level land cover and broad-level
    land use for each year.

    Because no algorithm performs best in all situations, LCMS uses an ensemble
    of models as predictors, which improves map accuracy across a range of
    ecosystems and change processes (Healey et al., 2018). The resulting suite
    of LCMS change, land cover, and land use maps offer a holistic depiction of
    landscape change across the United States over the past four decades.

    Predictor layers for the LCMS model include outputs from the LandTrendr and
    CCDC change detection algorithms, and terrain information. These components
    are all accessed and processed using Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al.,
    2017).

    Landsat Tier 1 and Sentinel 2A, 2B Level-1C top of atmosphere reflectance
    data are used directly in CCDC and to produce annual composites for
    LandTrendr. cFmask (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012) (Landsat-only), cloudScore
    (Chastain et al., 2019) (Landsat-only), and s2cloudless (Sentinel-Hub, 2021)
    (Sentinel 2-only) are used to mask clouds, while TDOM (Chastain et al.,
    2019) is used to mask cloud shadows (Landsat and Sentinel 2). For
    LandTrendr, the annual medoid is then computed to summarize cloud and cloud
    shadow-free values from each year into a single composite.

    The composite time series is temporally segmented using LandTrendr (Kennedy
    et al., 2010; Kennedy et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2018).

    All cloud and cloud shadow free values are also temporally segmented using
    the CCDC algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014).

    The raw composite values, LandTrendr fitted values, pair-wise differences,
    segment duration, change magnitude, and slope, and CCDC September 1 sine and
    cosine coefficients (first 3 harmonics), fitted values, and pairwise
    differences, along with elevation, slope, sine of aspect, cosine of aspect,
    and topographic position indices (Weiss, 2001) from the Digital Elevation
    Models of Puerto Rico (Taylor et al 2008) and the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration Digital Elevation Model for USVI (Love et
    al. 2014), are used as independent predictor variables in a Random Forest
    (Breiman, 2001) model.

    Reference data are collected using TimeSync, a web-based tool that helps
    analysts visualize and interpret the Landsat data record from 1984-present
    (Cohen et al., 2010).

          Raw LCMS modeled probability of Slow Loss. Defined as: Slow Loss includes the following
          classes from the TimeSync change process interpretation-

            * Structural Decline - Land where trees or other woody vegetation is physically altered by
            unfavorable growing conditions brought on by non-anthropogenic or non-mechanical factors.
            This type of loss should generally create a trend in the spectral signal(s) (e.g. NDVI
            decreasing, Wetness decreasing; SWIR increasing; etc.) however the trend can be subtle.
            Structural decline occurs in woody vegetation environments, most likely from insects,
            disease, drought, acid rain, etc. Structural decline can include defoliation events that do
            not result in mortality such as in Gypsy moth and spruce budworm infestations which may
            recover within 1 or 2 years.

            * Spectral Decline - A plot where the spectral signal shows a
            trend in one or more of the spectral bands or indices (e.g. NDVI decreasing, Wetness
            decreasing; SWIR increasing; etc.). Examples include cases where: a) non-forest/non-woody
            vegetation shows a trend suggestive of decline (e.g. NDVI decreasing, Wetness decreasing;
            SWIR increasing; etc.), or b) where woody vegetation shows a decline trend which is not
            related to the loss of woody vegetation, such as when mature tree canopies close resulting
            in increased shadowing, when species composition changes from conifer to hardwood, or when
            a dry period (as opposed to stronger, more acute drought) causes an apparent decline in
            vigor, but no loss of woody material or leaf area.

          Raw LCMS modeled probability of Fast Loss. Defined as: Fast Loss includes the following
          classes from the TimeSync change process interpretation-

          * Fire - Land altered by fire, regardless of the cause of the ignition (natural or
          anthropogenic), severity, or land use.

          * Harvest - Forest land where trees, shrubs or other vegetation have been severed or removed
          by anthropogenic means. Examples include clearcutting, salvage logging after fire or insect
          outbreaks, thinning and other forest management prescriptions (e.g. shelterwood/seedtree
          harvest).

          * Mechanical - Non-forest land where trees, shrubs or other vegetation has been mechanically
          severed or removed by chaining, scraping, brush sawing, bulldozing, or any other methods of
          non-forest vegetation removal.

          * Wind/ice - Land (regardless of use) where vegetation is altered by wind from hurricanes,
          tornados, storms and other severe weather events including freezing rain from ice
          storms.

          * Hydrology - Land where flooding has significantly altered woody cover or other Land cover
          elements regardless of land use (e.g. new mixtures of gravel and vegetation in and around
          streambeds after a flood).

          * Debris - Land (regardless of use) altered by natural material movement associated with
          landslides, avalanches, volcanos, debris flows, etc.

          * Other - Land (regardless of use) where the spectral trend or other supporting evidence
          suggests a disturbance or change event has occurred but the definitive cause cannot be
          determined or the type of change fails to meet any of the change process categories defined

        description: |||
          Raw LCMS modeled probability of Gain. Defined as: Land exhibiting an increase in vegetation
          cover due to growth and succession over one or more years. Applicable to any areas that may
          express spectral change associated with vegetation regrowth. In developed areas, growth can
          result from maturing vegetation and/or newly installed lawns and landscaping. In forests,
          growth includes vegetation growth from bare ground, as well as the over topping of
          intermediate and co-dominate trees and/or lower-lying grasses and shrubs. Growth/Recovery
          segments recorded following forest harvest will likely transition through different land
          cover classes as the forest regenerates. For these changes to be considered growth/recovery,
          spectral values should closely adhere to an increasing trend line (e.g. a positive slope
          that would, if extended to ~20 years, be on the order of .10 units of NDVI) which persists
          for several years.
