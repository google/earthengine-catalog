    This product is part of the Landscape Change Monitoring System (LCMS) data suite.
    It shows LCMS-modeled change, land cover, and/or land use classes for each year and
    covers the Conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as areas outside the CONUS (OCONUS) 
    including Alaska (AK), Puerto Rico-US Virgin Islands (PRUSVI), and Hawaii (HI). PRUSVI and HI 
    v2024.10 data will be released late summer 2025. For now v2023.9 PRUSVI and HI LCMS data can 
    be used (USFS/GTAC/LCMS/v2023-9). 

    LCMS is a remote sensing-based system for mapping and monitoring landscape change across the
    United States. Its objective is to develop a consistent approach using the latest technology
    and advancements in change detection to produce a "best available" map of landscape change.

    Outputs include three annual products: change, land cover, and land use. The change model output relates specifically to vegetation cover and includes slow loss, fast loss (which also includes hydrologic changes such as inundation or desiccation), and gain. These values are predicted for each year of the Landsat time series and serve as the foundational products for LCMS. We apply a ruleset based on ancillary datasets to create the final change product, which is a
    refinement/reclassification of the modeled change to 15 classes that explicitly provide information on the cause of landscape change (e.g., Tree Removal, Wildfire, Wind damage). Land cover and land use maps depict life-form level land cover and broad-level land use for each year.

    Because no algorithm performs best in all situations, LCMS uses an ensemble of models as
    predictors, which improves map accuracy across a range of ecosystems and change processes
    (Healey et al., 2018). The resulting suite of LCMS change, land cover, and land use maps offer
    a holistic depiction of landscape change across the United States since 1985.

    Predictor layers for the LCMS model include outputs from the LandTrendr and CCDC change detection 
    algorithms, and terrain information. These components are all accessed and processed using Google 
    Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017).

    To produce annual composites for LandTrendr, USGS Collection 2 Landsat Tier 1 and Sentinel 2A,
    2B Level-1C top of atmosphere reflectance data were used. The cFmask cloud masking algorithm
    (Foga et al., 2017), which is an implementation of Fmask 2.0 (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012)
    (Landsat-only), cloudScore (Chastain et al., 2019) (Landsat-only), s2cloudless
    (Sentinel-Hub, 2021) and Cloud Score plus (Pasquarella et al., 2023) (Sentinel 2-only) are 
    used to mask clouds, while TDOM (Chastain et al., 2019) is used to mask cloud shadows (Landsat and Sentinel
    2). For LandTrendr, the annual medoid is then computed to summarize cloud and cloud shadow-free values 
    from each year into a single composite. For CCDC, United States Geological Survey (USGS) Collection 2 
    Landsat Tier 1 surface reflectance data were used for the CONUS, and Landsat Tier 1 top of atmosphere 
    reflectance data for AK, PRUSVI, and HI. 

    The composite time series is temporally segmented using LandTrendr
    (Kennedy et al., 2010; Kennedy et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2018).

    All cloud and cloud shadow free values are also temporally segmented using the CCDC algorithm
    (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014).

    Predictor data include raw composite values, LandTrendr fitted values, pair-wise differences,
    segment duration, change magnitude, and slope, and CCDC sine and
    cosine coefficients (first 3 harmonics), fitted values, and pairwise
    differences, along with elevation, slope, sine of aspect, cosine of aspect,
    and topographic position indices (Weiss, 2001) from the 10 m USGS 3D Elevation
    Program (3DEP) data (U.S. Geological Survey, 2019).

    Reference data are collected using TimeSync, a web-based tool that helps
    analysts visualize and interpret the Landsat data record from 1984-present (Cohen et al., 2010).

    Random Forest models (Breiman, 2001) were trained using reference data from TimeSync and predictor data 
    from LandTrendr, CCDC, and terrain indices to predict annual change, land cover, and land use classes. 
    Following modeling, we institute a series of probability thresholds and rulesets using ancillary datasets 
    to improve qualitative map outputs and reduce commission and omission. More information can be found in 
    the LCMS Methods Brief included in the Description.

          Final thematic LCMS change product. A total of fifteen change classes are mapped for each year. Foundationally, change is modeled with three separate binary Random Forest models for each study area: slow loss, fast loss, and gain. Each pixel is assigned to the modeled change class with the highest probability that is also above a specified threshold. Any pixel that does not have any value above each class's respective threshold is assigned to the Stable class. Following a ruleset using the modeled change class, ancillary datasets (such as TCC, MTBS, and IDS), and LCMS Land Cover data, one of the 15 refined, cause of change classes is assigned to each pixel. See the LCMS Methods Brief linked to in the Description for full details on the ruleset and the ancillary datasets used.

          Final thematic LCMS land cover product. A total of 14 land cover classes are mapped on an
          annual basis using TimeSync reference data and spectral information derived from Landsat
          imagery. Land cover is predicted using a single multiclass Random Forest model, which outputs an array of the probabilities of each class (proportion of the trees within the Random Forest model that 'chose' each class). Final classes are assigned to the land use with the highest probability. Prior to assigning the land cover class with the highest probability, depending on the study area, one to several probability thresholds and rulesets using ancillary datasets were applied. More information on the probability thresholds and rulesets can be found in the LCMS Methods Brief linked to in the Description. Seven land cover classes indicate a single land cover, where that land cover type covers most of the pixel's area and no other class covers more than 10% of the pixel. There are also seven mixed classes. These represent pixels in which an additional land cover class covers at least 10% of the pixel.

          Raw LCMS modeled probability of Slow Loss. Slow Loss includes the following
          classes from the TimeSync change process interpretation:

            * Structural Decline - Land where trees or other woody vegetation is physically altered by
            unfavorable growing conditions brought on by non-anthropogenic or non-mechanical factors.
            This type of loss should generally create a trend in the spectral signal(s) (e.g. NDVI
            decreasing, Wetness decreasing; SWIR increasing; etc.) however the trend can be subtle.
            Structural decline occurs in woody vegetation environments, most likely from insects,
            disease, drought, acid rain, etc. Structural decline can include defoliation events that do
            not result in mortality such as in Gypsy moth and spruce budworm infestations which may
            recover within 1 or 2 years.

            * Spectral Decline - A plot where the spectral signal shows a
            trend in one or more of the spectral bands or indices (e.g. NDVI decreasing, Wetness
            decreasing; SWIR increasing; etc.). Examples include cases where: a) non-forest/non-woody
            vegetation shows a trend suggestive of decline (e.g. NDVI decreasing, Wetness decreasing;
            SWIR increasing; etc.), or b) where woody vegetation shows a decline trend which is not
            related to the loss of woody vegetation, such as when mature tree canopies close resulting
            in increased shadowing, when species composition changes from conifer to hardwood, or when
            a dry period (as opposed to stronger, more acute drought) causes an apparent decline in
            vigor, but no loss of woody material or leaf area.

          Raw LCMS modeled probability of Fast Loss. Fast Loss includes the following
          classes from the TimeSync change process interpretation:

          * Fire - Land altered by fire, regardless of the cause of the ignition (natural or
          anthropogenic), severity, or land use.

          * Harvest - Forest land where trees, shrubs or other vegetation have been severed or removed
          by anthropogenic means. Examples include clearcutting, salvage logging after fire or insect
          outbreaks, thinning and other forest management prescriptions (e.g. shelterwood/seedtree
          harvest).

          * Mechanical - Non-forest land where trees, shrubs or other vegetation has been mechanically
          severed or removed by chaining, scraping, brush sawing, bulldozing, or any other methods of
          non-forest vegetation removal.

          * Wind/ice - Land (regardless of use) where vegetation is altered by wind from hurricanes,
          tornados, storms and other severe weather events including freezing rain from ice
          storms.

          * Hydrology - Land where flooding has significantly altered woody cover or other Land cover
          elements regardless of land use (e.g. new mixtures of gravel and vegetation in and around
          streambeds after a flood).

          * Debris - Land (regardless of use) altered by natural material movement associated with
          landslides, avalanches, volcanos, debris flows, etc.

          Raw LCMS modeled probability of Gain. Defined as: Land exhibiting an increase in vegetation
          cover due to growth and succession over one or more years. Applicable to any areas that may
          express spectral change associated with vegetation regrowth. In developed areas, growth can
          result from maturing vegetation and/or newly installed lawns and landscaping. In forests,
          growth includes vegetation growth from bare ground, as well as the over topping of
          intermediate and co-dominate trees and/or lower-lying grasses and shrubs. Growth/Recovery
          segments recorded following forest harvest will likely transition through different land
          cover classes as the forest regenerates. For these changes to be considered growth/recovery,
          spectral values should closely adhere to an increasing trend line (e.g. a positive slope
          that would, if extended to ~20 years, be on the order of .10 units of NDVI) which persists
          for several years.
