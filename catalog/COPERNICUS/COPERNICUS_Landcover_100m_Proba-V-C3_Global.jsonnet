  title: 'Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers: CGLS-LC100 Collection 3',
  version: 'V3.01',
  'gee:type': ee_const.gee_type.image_collection,
  description: |||
    The Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) is earmarked as a component of
    the Land service to operate a multi-purpose service component that provides
    a series of bio-geophysical products on the status and evolution of land
    surface at global scale.

    The Dynamic Land Cover map at 100 m resolution (CGLS-LC100) is a new product
    in the portfolio of the CGLS and delivers a global land cover map at 100 m
    spatial resolution. The CGLS Land Cover product provides a primary land
    cover scheme. Next to these discrete classes, the product also includes
    continuous field layers for all basic land cover classes that provide
    proportional estimates for vegetation/ground cover for the land cover types.
    This continuous classification scheme may depict areas of heterogeneous
    land cover better than the standard classification scheme and, as such,
    can be tailored for application use (e.g. forest monitoring, crop monitoring,
    biodiversity and conservation, monitoring environment and security in Africa,
    climate modelling, etc.).

    These consistent Land Cover maps (v3.0.1) are provided for the period
    2015-2019 over the entire Globe, derived from the PROBA-V 100 m time-series, a
    database of high quality land cover training sites and several ancillary
    datasets, reaching an accuracy of 80% at Level1 over al years.  It is planned
    to provide yearly updates from 2020 through the use of a Sentinel time-series.
