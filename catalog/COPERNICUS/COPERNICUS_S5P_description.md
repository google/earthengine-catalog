### Sentinel-5 Precursor

Sentinel-5 Precursor is a satellite launched on 13 October 2017
by the European Space Agency to monitor air pollution.  The onboard sensor
is frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).

All of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near 
Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline (OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. 
The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL assets, but appear more 
quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data from a single orbit 
(which, due to half the earth being dark, contains data only for a single 
hemisphere).

Because of noise on the data, negative vertical column values are often
observed in particular over clean regions or for low SO2 emissions. It is
recommended not to filter these values except for outliers, i.e.
for vertical columns lower than -0.001 mol/m^2.

The original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned
by time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data
into Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping
a single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products
is performed).

Source products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine
assets, with suffixes _1 and _2.

The conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)
tool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to
remove pixels with QA values less than:

*  80% for AER_AI
*  75% for the tropospheric_NO2_column_number_density band of NO2
*  50% for all other datasets except for O3 and SO2

The O3_TCL product is ingested directly (without running harpconvert).
