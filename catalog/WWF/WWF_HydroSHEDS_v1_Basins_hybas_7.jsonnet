  description: |||
    HydroSHEDS is a mapping product that provides hydrographic
    information for regional and global-scale applications in a consistent
    format. It offers a suite of geo-referenced datasets (vector and
    raster) at various scales, including river networks, watershed
    boundaries, drainage directions, and flow accumulations. HydroSHEDS
    is based on elevation data obtained in 2000 by NASA's Shuttle Radar
    Topography Mission (SRTM).

    This dataset provides polygons of nested, hierarchical watersheds, based on
    15 arc-seconds (approx. 500 m at the equator) resolution raster data.
    The watersheds range from level 1 (coarse) to level 12 (detailed), using Pfastetter codes.

    Technical documentation:

    [https://hydrosheds.org/images/inpages/HydroBASINS_TechDoc_v1c.pdf](https://hydrosheds.org/images/inpages/HydroBASINS_TechDoc_v1c.pdf)

    Note that the quality of the HydroSHEDS data is significantly lower for regions above
    60 degrees northern latitude as there is no underlying SRTM elevation data available
    and thus a coarser-resolution DEM was (HYDRO1k provided by USGS).

    HydroSHEDS was developed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
    Conservation Science Program in partnership with the U.S. Geological
    Survey, the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, The
    Nature Conservancy, and the Center for Environmental Systems Research
    of the University of Kassel, Germany.

          First 1 digit represents the region:
            * 1 = Africa
            * 2 = Europe
            * 3 = Siberia
            * 4 = Asia
            * 5 = Australia
            * 6 = South America
            * 7 = North America
            * 8 = Arctic (North America)
            * 9 = Greenland.

          Next 2 digits define the Pfafstetter level (01-12). The value '00' is used for the
          'Level 0' layer that contains all original sub-basins and all Pfafstetter codes (at
          all levels); 'Level 0' only exists in the standard format of HydroBASINS
          (without lakes).

          Next 6 digits represent a unique identifier within the HydroSHEDS network;
          values larger than 900,000 represent lakes and only occur in the customized
          format (with lakes)

          Last 1 digit indicates the side of a sub-basin in relation to the river network (0 =
          noSide; 1 = Left; 2 = Right). Sides are only defined for the customized format
          (with lakes).
