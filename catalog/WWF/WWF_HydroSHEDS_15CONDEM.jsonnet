  description: |||
    HydroSHEDS is a mapping product that provides hydrographic
    information for regional and global-scale applications in a consistent
    format. It offers a suite of geo-referenced datasets (vector and
    raster) at various scales, including river networks, watershed
    boundaries, drainage directions, and flow accumulations. HydroSHEDS
    is based on elevation data obtained in 2000 by NASA's Shuttle Radar
    Topography Mission (SRTM).

    This hydrologically conditioned elevation dataset is the result of an iterative conditioning and correction process. Note that the conditioning process alters the original DEM and may render it incorrect for applications other than deriving drainage directions. Endorheic basins (inland sinks) are 'seeded' with a no-data cell at their lowest point in order to terminate the flow. Full details of the underlying digital elevation model are available in the HydroSHEDS website and documentation.

    This dataset is at 15 arc-second resolution. The datasets available at 15 arc-seconds are the Hydrologically Conditioned DEM, Drainage (Flow) Direction, and Flow Accumulation.

    Note that the quality of the HydroSHEDS data is significantly lower for regions above
    60 degrees northern latitude as there is no underlying SRTM elevation data available
    and thus a coarser-resolution DEM was (HYDRO1k provided by USGS).

    HydroSHEDS was developed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
    Conservation Science Program in partnership with the U.S. Geological
    Survey, the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, The
    Nature Conservancy, and the Center for Environmental Systems Research
    of the University of Kassel, Germany.
