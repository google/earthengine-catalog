  description: |||
    This image collection provides per-pixel probability that the underlying
    area is part of an oil palm plantation.

    These probability estimates are provided at 10 meter resolution, and have
    been generated by a machine learning model. Labeled examples of oil palm
    plantations were supplied by community contributors to the Forest Data
    Partnership. The predictors are annual composites built from publicly
    available satellite imagery provided by Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2,
    and ALOS DSM. Probability predictions are provided for an individual year,
    denoted by the start and end time on each image in the collection. For the
    initial version, predictions based on mosaics of 2020 imagery and 2023
    imagery are included.

    The community data product is meant to evolve over time, as more data comes
    in from the community and the community model to produce the maps
    continuously improves. If you would like to provide feedback on these
    layers, please visit our
    [Collect Earth Online](https://app.collect.earth/review-institution?institutionId=2494)
    project to contribute.

    [20240312 model on Github](https://github.com/google/forest-data-partnership/tree/main/models).
