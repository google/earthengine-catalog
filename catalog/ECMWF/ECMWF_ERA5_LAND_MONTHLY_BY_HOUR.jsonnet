  title: 'ERA5-Land Monthly Averaged by Hour of Day - ECMWF Climate Reanalysis',
  'gee:type': ee_const.gee_type.image_collection,
  description: |||
    ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables
    over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5. ERA5-Land has been produced by
    replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model
    data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset
    using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time,
    providing an accurate description of the climate of the past. This dataset includes all 50
    variables as available on CDS.

    The data presented here is a subset of the full ERA5-Land dataset post-processed by ECMWF.
    Monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated to facilitate many applications requiring easy and
    fast access to the data, when sub-monthly fields are not required.

    Please note that the convention for accumulations used in ERA5-Land differs with that for ERA5.
    The accumulations are treated the same as those in ERA-Interim or ERA-Interim/Land, i.e., they
    are accumulated from the beginning of the forecast to the end of the forecast step. This happens
    within every day and gets reset on midnight. The Earth Engine Data team added 19 additional bands,
    one for each of the accumulation bands, with the hourly values computed as the difference
    between two consecutive forecast steps.

    ERA5-Land data is available from 1950 to three months from real-time. More information
    can be found at the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).

          Potential evaporation (pev) in the current ECMWF model is computed, by making a second call to
          the surface energy balance routine with the vegetation variables set to "crops/mixed farming"
          and assuming no stress from soil moisture. In other words, evaporation is computed for
          agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by
          this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although pev is
          meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic
          results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air. This variable is
          accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.
