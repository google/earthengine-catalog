  description: |||
    LANDFIRE (LF), Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools, is a
    shared program between the wildland fire management programs of the U.S.
    Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, U.S. Department of the Interior's
    Geological Survey, and The Nature Conservancy.

    LANDFIRE (LF) layers are created using predictive landscape models based on
    extensive field-referenced data, satellite imagery and biophysical gradient
    layers using classification and regression trees.

    Existing Vegetation Height (EVH) represents the average height of the dominant vegetation for a 30-m cell.
    Canopy height is generated separately for tree, shrub, and herbaceous lifeforms using training data and other geospatial layers. EVH is determined by the average height weighted by species cover and based on the Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) lifeform.

    * Decision tree models using field reference data, lidar, Landsat, and ancillary data are developed separately for each lifeform. Decision tree relationships are used to generate lifeform specific height class layers, which are merged into a single composite EVH layer.

    * Disturbance data were used to develop LF Remap products for LFRDB plot filtering and to ensure 2015 and 2016 disturbances were included that were not visible in the source imagery.

    * The EVC product is then reconciled through QA/QC measures to ensure life-form is synchronized with both Existing Vegetation Cover and EVT products.

    LF uses EVH in several subsequent layers, including the development of the fuel products.

    The LANDIFRE Vegetation datasets include:

    * Biophysical Settings (BPS)
    * Environmental Site Potential (ESP)
    * Existing Vegetation Canopy Cover (EVC)
    * Existing Vegetation Height (EVH).
    * Existing Vegetation Type (EVT)
    These layers are created using predictive landscape models based on extensive
    field-referenced data, satellite imagery and biophysical gradient layers using
    classification and regression trees.
