  description: |||
    LANDFIRE (LF), Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools, is a
    shared program between the wildland fire management programs of the U.S.
    Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, U.S. Department of the Interior's
    Geological Survey, and The Nature Conservancy.

    Landfire (LF) Historical fire regimes, intervals, and vegetation conditions
    are mapped using the Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool (VDDT).
    These data support fire and landscape management planning goals in
    the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy, the Federal Wildland
    Fire Management Policy, and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act.

    The Percent of Low-severity Fire (PLS) layer quantifies the amount of low-severity fires relative to mixed- and replacement-severity fires under the presumed historical fire regime.
    Low severity is defined as less than 25 percent average top-kill within a typical fire perimeter for a given vegetation type.
    PLS was derived from the vegetation and disturbance dynamics model VDDT (Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool) (LF 1.0.0 CONUS only used the vegetation and disturbance dynamics model LANDSUM).
    This layer is intended to describe one component of historical fire regime characteristics in the context of the broader historical time period represented by the LANDFIRE (LF) Biophysical Settings (BPS) layer and BPS Model documentation.
    This layer is created by linking the BPS Group attribute in the BPS layer with the Refresh Model Tracker (RMT) data and assigning the PLS attribute.
    This geospatial product should display a reasonable approximation of PLS, as documented in the RMT.
    PLS is used in landscape assessments.

    The LANDIFRE Fire datasets include:

    * Fire Regime Groups (FRG) is intended to characterize presumed historical
      fire regimes within landscapes based on interactions between vegetation
      dynamics, fire spread, fire effects, and spatial context
    * Mean Fire Return Interval (MFRI) quantifies the average period between
      fires under the presumed historical fire regime
    * Percent of Low-severity Fire (PLS) image quantifies the amount of
      low-severity fires relative to mixed- and replacement-severity fires
      under the presumed historical fire regime and is defined as less than 25
      percent average top-kill within a typical fire perimeter for a given
      vegetation type
    * Percent of Mixed-severity Fire (PMS) layer quantifies the amount of
      mixed-severity fires relative to low- and replacement-severity fires under
      the presumed historical fire regime, and is defined as between 25 and 75
      percent average top-kill within a typical fire perimeter for a given
      vegetation type
    * Percent of Replacement-severity Fire (PRS) layer quantifies the amount of
      replacement-severity fires relative to low- and mixed-severity fires under
      the presumed historical fire regime, and is defined as greater than 75
      percent average top-kill within a typical fire perimeter for a given
      vegetation type
    * Succession Classes (SClass) layer characterizes current vegetation conditions
      with respect to the vegetation species composition, cover, and height ranges
      of successional states that occur within each biophysical setting
    * Vegetation Condition Class (VCC) represents a simple categorization of the
      associated Vegetation Departure (VDEP) layer and indicates the general level
      to which current vegetation is different from the simulated historical
      vegetation reference conditions
    * Vegetation Departure (VDep) indicates how different current vegetation on a
      landscape is from estimated historical conditions. VDep is based on changes
      to species composition, structural stage, and canopy closure.
