  description: |||
    The Defense Meteorological Program (DMSP) Operational Line-Scan System
    (OLS) has a unique capability to detect visible and near-infrared (VNIR)
    emission sources at night.

    Version 4 of the DMSP-OLS Nighttime Lights Time Series consists of
    cloud-free composites made using all the available archived DMSP-OLS smooth
    resolution data for calendar years. In cases where two satellites were
    collecting data, two composites were produced.

    Image and data processing by NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center.
    DMSP data collected by US Air Force Weather Agency.

          Cloud-free coverages tally the total number of observations
          that went into each 30-arc second grid cell. This band can be used to
          identify areas with low numbers of observations where the quality is

          The average visible band digital number (DN) of cloud-free
          light detections multiplied by the percent frequency of light detection.
          The inclusion of the percent frequency of detection term normalizes the
          resulting digital values for variations in the persistence of lighting.
          For instance, the value for a light only detected half the time is
          discounted by 50%. Note that this product contains detections from fires
          and a variable amount of background noise.
