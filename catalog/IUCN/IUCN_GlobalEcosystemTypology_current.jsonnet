  description: |||
      The Global Ecosystem Typology is a taxonomy of ecosystems based on
      their unique characteristics. It is a global classification system
      that provides a consistent framework for describing and classifying
      ecological ecosystems.

      The Global Ecosystem Typology has six levels. The top three levels
      (realms, functional biomes, and ecosystem functional groups) classify
      ecosystems based on their overall characteristics, such as their location,
      dominant plant life, and ecological processes. The bottom three levels
      (regional ecosystem subgroups, global ecosystem types, and subglobal
      ecosystem types) focus on specific geographic variants within ecosystem
      functional groups and complexes of organisms and their associated physical
      environment, providing a more detailed understanding of particular
      ecosystems.

      This dataset focuses on the third level of the Global Ecosystem Typology:
      Ecosystem Functional Group. It's defined as a group of related ecosystems
      within a biome that share common ecological drivers, which in turn promote
      similar biotic traits that characterise the group. Derived from the
      top-down by subdivision of biomes.

      NOTE: Due to the size of some geometries, a simpification algorithm was
      applied to each one to reduce their complexity. As many vertices as
      possible were discarded without moving the distance from the original
      shape more than 100 m. As a result, approximately two dozen rows in the
      table collapsed into geometries with 0 area and were removed.
