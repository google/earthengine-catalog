#### 13. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE

All disputes arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement (including formation, performance, breach, enforceability, and validity of this Agreement) shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration to be held in the English language in the City of New York, State of New York, county of New York, pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.
Both you and us will share the costs of arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, equally, unless the arbitration award provides otherwise.  There shall be only one (1) arbitrator.  Each Party will bear the cost of preparing and presenting its case, provided, however, that the costs in preparing the case and the fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be fully borne by you if judgement is rendered against you, in whole or in part.  The arbitrator will have no power or authority to make awards or issue orders of any kind except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.  The arbitrator will state his/her opinion in writing along with his/her reasons for the decision.  The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding.  The award may be confirmed and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. You agree to waive any right you may have in any legal proceeding arising from or related to this Agreement outside of arbitration.
Without prejudice to the agreement to resolve disputes in binding arbitration set forth in the previous paragraph, either party to this Agreement may obtain preliminary injunctive relief in the Circuit Court of New York County, NY, located in the City of New York, NY, for the purpose of enforcing any of the terms of this Agreement pending a final determination in arbitration or permanent relief for the purpose of enforcing arbitral awards.

You shall not make a claim against us, and we will not be liable with respect to the recoupment of any expenditures or investment made by you in anticipation of the continuation of this Agreement beyond the term hereof.
The parties agree that breach of the provisions of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to us which would be both difficult to ascertain and which would not be compensable by damages alone.  As such, the parties agree that we have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement by injunction (without necessity of posting bond), specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies we may have for your breach of this Agreement.
The validity and effect of these Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of New York State, without regard to its conflicts or choice of laws principles.

This Agreement, including any other agreements or additional terms referenced herein, constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the Agreement between the parties with respect to the Data offered via the Platform, and, unless otherwise expressly provided herein, it supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, statements and understandings, whether oral or written, between the parties concerning the Data.

As so reformed or modified, the court shall fully enforce this Agreement.  The provisions of this Agreement that by their content are intended to survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, including, without limitation, provisions governing ownership and use of intellectual property, representations, disclaimers, warranties, liability, indemnification, governing law, jurisdiction, venue, remedies, rights after termination and interpretation of this Agreement, will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for their full statutory period.
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall not apply to this Agreement.

We make no representation that the Data is appropriate to or available in locations outside of the United States.
