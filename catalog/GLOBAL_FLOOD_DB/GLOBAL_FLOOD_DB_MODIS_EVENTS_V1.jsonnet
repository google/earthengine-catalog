  description: |||
    The Global Flood Database contains maps of the extent and
    temporal distribution of 913 flood events occurring between 2000-2018. For more
    information, see
    [the associated journal article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03695-w).

    Flood events were collected from
    the [Dartmouth Flood Observatory](https://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/)
    and used to collect MODIS imagery. The selected
    913 events are those that were successfully mapped (passed quality control as
    having significant inundation beyond permanent water) using 12,719 scenes from
    Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors. Each pixel was classified as water or non-water
    at 250-meter resolution during the full date range of each flood event and
    subsequent data products were generated including maximum flood extent
    ("flooded" band) and the duration of inundation in days ("duration" band).
    Water and non-water classifications during a flood event include permanent
    water (here resampling the 30-meter
    [JRC Global Surface Water dataset](https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/)
    representing permanent water to 250-meter resolution), which can be
    masked out to isolate flood water using the "jrc_perm_water" band.
    Extra data quality
    bands were added representing cloud conditions during the flood event (e.g.,
    "clear_views" representing the number of clear days the flood was observed
    between its start and end dates and "clear_perc" representing the percentage of
    clear day observation of the total event duration in days).

    Each image in the ImageCollection represents the map of an individual flood.
    The collection can be filtered
    by date, country, or Dartmouth Flood Observatory original ID.
