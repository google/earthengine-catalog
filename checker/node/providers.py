"""Check for the providers field.

Providers are described here:

https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/collection-spec/collection-spec.md#provider-object

> A provider is any of the organizations that captures or processes the content
> of the Collection and therefore influences the data offered by this
> Collection. May also include information about the final storage provider
> hosting the data.

The rules for providers:
- 'providers' is a list of dictionaries
- There must be at least 2 providers with the last one being the Google host
- Each provider dictionary has 3 required fields: 'name', 'roles', and 'url'
- The name is a string that starts with a capital letter, is 2 to 181 letters
  long, and can contain ASCII letters, numbers, and characters in " -_ '.,:"
- The roles section is a list of one more of these strings:
  host, licensor, processor, and producer
- The roles for each provider must be sorted and there cannot be duplicates
  within one provider.  There can be multiple providers with any of the roles.
- The processor role is optional.  All three of the others must appear at least
  once in one of the providers
- The url must start with https or http.  Please use https unless the site
  absolutely cannot use TLS
- The Google host entry at the end must have the URL for the dataset in the
  html devsite public data catalog.
- Please use the jsonnet functions from earthengine.libsonnet whenever possible

https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/collection-spec/collection-spec.md#provider-object

Example in Jsonnet:

  providers: [
    ee.producer_provider(
      'A provider name', 'https://example.com'),
    ee.host_provider(self_ee_catalog_url)],

Example in JSON:

   "providers": [
      {
         "name": "A provider name",
         "roles": ["licensor", "producer"],
         "url": "https://example.com"
      }, {
         "name": "Google Earth Engine",
         "roles": ["host"],
         "url": "https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ORG_THING"
      }],
